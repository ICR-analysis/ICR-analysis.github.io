Scripts written for specific problems at the ICR will now gradually be made available under [Internal Resources](https://icr-analysis.github.io/internal-resources/).

If you have any scripts/macros/pipelines etc that could be useful for other researchers at the ICR (however small, specialised or hacked together), please do share them.
