The course *Introduction to image analysis* will be run again on October<sup>17th</sup> from 10am to 3pm in the CBL ground floor computer training room, places can be booked [here](https://training.icr.ac.uk/coursed.php?course=786) (ICR login required).

The course is a very basic introduction to image analysis, for those new to the ICR, new to image analysis, or just not particularly confident analysing their data. The course will use the popular open-source software, ImageJ, but the main focus is the fundamentals of image analysis, which can be applied in any software.
