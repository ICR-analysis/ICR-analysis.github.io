This blog is designed to support image analysis at the Institute of Cancer Research (predominantly fluorescence microscopy). The main aims are:

* To provide a central repository to share best practices, and to standardise image analysis across the ICR where possible.
* To allow sharing of resources (pipelines, scripts etc).
* To prevent information and expertise being lost when people leave the ICR.
