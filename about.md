This blog is designed to support image analysis at the Institute of Cancer Research (predominantly fluroescence microscopy). The main aim is to allow sharing of resources (pipelines, scripts etc).

If you have anything you would like to add, or if you have any questions, please get in touch at <adam.tyson@icr.ac.uk>.
